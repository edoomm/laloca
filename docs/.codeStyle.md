## Intro
The code style is based on JSDoc
For more information, please reading from the website: https://jsdoc.app/

This style guide intends to list out the JSDoc tags that are used in this project.
JSDoc is used for javascript mostly. However, since the codebase of this project is Google Scipt gs which is similiar to javascript, the code style for this project is based on JSDoc.

All JSDoc comments are of the forms:

*Single line:*
```js
/** jsdoc comment here */
```

*Multiple lines:*
```js
/**
 *  jsdoc comment here
 *  and here
 *  and even here
 */
```

The double slash // commenting style for non-JSDoc comments. JSDoc comments are used for documentation whereas the // commenting style is leveraged for detail-oriented notes.

## File

```js/**
 * @fileOverview  Write what is going on in the file here
 *
 * @author        Ex. Kevin Mai
 * @author        Ex. Eduardo Mendoza
 *
 * @spreadSheet   Write the spreadsheet is affected by the code in this file
 *
 * @functionality Write the function of code in this file
 * @functionality Ex. deleteEvent
 * @functionality Ex. addEvent
 *
 * @button        Write the button which is assigned to this script
 * @button        Ex. Sheet Tasks - Add Event
 * @button        Ex. Sheet Tasks - Add routine
 */
```
## Function
1. Comment
```js/**
 * @customFunction
 * Write what the function does
 *
 * @param {type}  name  [description]
 * @param {type}  name[default] [description]
 *
 * @returns {type} [defalut] [description]
 *
 * @throws  {exception}
 *
 * @example
 * example description
 * ...
 * ...
 */
 ```
2. Naming

* The name of a custom function must be distinct from the names of built-in functions like SUM().
* The name of a custom function cannot end with an underscore (\_), which denotes a private function in Apps Script.
* The name of a custom function must be declared with the syntax function myFunction(), not var myFunction = new Function().
* The name of a custome function start with an uncapitalized word then followed by capitalized words. Ex: getDataFromSheet().

## Variable
1. Naming:
* Constant: All letters are uppercase
* Variable: The variable name starts with an uncapitalized word then followed by capitalized words. Ex: eventStartDate
Try to use self-explaining variable name and not too long (less than 3 words)

## Practice

* Use constants instead of random numbers to assign variables to special value
* Use self-explaining constant name to describe the number.
Ex: ```js const ERROR_NOT_MATCHING_FORMAT = -2```
* Avoid writing a function with greater-than-2-identation code block. If possible, tear the function to smaller functions.
Ex: ```js
function setNewEvent (args) {
  getEventFromSheet ();
  writeEventToDatabase ();
  printNewEventToSheet ();
}```
